# Cars

My cars.sh is a simple program that elegantly executes the task at hand. :+1:

We were tasked with developing a script that would help users maintain an inventory of old cars.

## The Menu

The menu itself is very simple in nature.  It gives users the three options required to complete the task at hand:

* _Add_ a car
* _List_ the cars in the inventory file
* _Quit_ the program

To select a menu item, the user simply has to press the number of the corresponding option that they would like to complete.  1 to _Add_ a car, 2 to _List_ the cars in the inventory file, and 3 to _Quit_ the program.

## Adding a car

When adding a car, the user is prompted for the *Year*, *Make*, and *Model* of the car they are adding, one at a time in that order.  Upon successfully adding a car, the program prints out a confirmation message, showing what car was added.  When ready, the user can press any key to return to the main menu.

## List of the cars

The list of the cars is sorted by year, and the year, make, and model of the car are separated by spaces.  Each car takes up one line.

When the user is finished looking at the list of the cars, they can press any key to return to the main menu.

## Quitting the program

When quitting the program, the program bids you farewell.  Upon your next key press, the program will close and clear your screen.
